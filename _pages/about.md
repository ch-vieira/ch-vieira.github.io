I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) working in quantum information theory, and a member of the the [Quantum Information and Computation Initiative group (QICI)](https://qici.weebly.com/). I obtained my PhD from the [State University of Campinas (Unicamp)](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), where I was a member of the [Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory (MFQ)](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/) group. 

I am interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics, especially in Bell nonlocality (device-independent) communication and processing protocols.
